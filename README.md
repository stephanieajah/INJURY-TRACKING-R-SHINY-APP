# INJURY-TRACKING-R-SHINY-APP
We developed an interactive R Shiny Injury Dashboard to track workplace injuries across U.S. industries. Users can filter by company, industry, body part affected, severity and more. The app features two dashboards: one for severe injuries and another for occupational illnesses, offering valuable insights into workplace safety trends.
